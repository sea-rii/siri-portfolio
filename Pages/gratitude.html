          Thank you for letting me chase big, sometimes ridiculous dreams and still
          calling to check if I ate. Your quiet sacrifices and loud cheering are the
          backbone of everything I do.

          For being my safe place, my loudest supporter, and the person I can be

          Thank you for listening to rants, celebrating tiny wins, sending memes at 2 a.m.,
          and showing up even when I only said “it’s fine.” You make every semester survivable.

          To the people who saw potential before I did: thank you for the hard questions,

          Thank you for letting me learn, experiment, break things, fix them, and talk
          about bias and models for way too long. You made research feel like a
          community, not just a project.

          Recruiters, interviewers, program coordinators — thank you for reading the

          For getting back up after rough semesters, scary emails, and silent rejections.
