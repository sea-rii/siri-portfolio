# 🎬 Netflix-Style Portfolio

> _"If Netflix can have categories for everything, why can’t I have one for my life?"_

Welcome to my **Netflix-style personal portfolio** — a cinematic, scrollable experience where my **projects**, **books**, **music**, and **quotes** are laid out like shows on a streaming platform.

Think:
- Dark UI  
- Bold typography  
- Scrollable “rows” of cards  
- Cozy little micro-interactions on hover  

This repo contains the full source code for my portfolio website.
